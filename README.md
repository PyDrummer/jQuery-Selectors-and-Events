# jQuery-Selectors-and-Events
Lab: 02

This website displays a grid of images. The dropdown menu allows the user to click an option. The website will then display all images that matches that option.

10-2: Henry Funk and Anthony Beaver have collaborated on this file.

Time it took: 5 hours? We had some troubles selecting the child elements with jQuery which took the most amount of time. 

10-5: Brandon really helped us out with the rendering and refactoring my code so it actually works! lol.
